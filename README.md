algernon's layout
=======================

This is an unconventional layout for the ErgoDox EZ: first of all, it is based
on the Dvorak layout, but moves a few keys elsewhere for an improved coding
experience. Second, there is no `DEL` key, nor a `Caps Lock`. Third, the
`SHIFT`, `Alt`, and `Control` keys are all sticky: when you press and release
them, they still register pressed, until you toggle them off.

But lets get on with the base layer, before I dive into a deeper explanation!
